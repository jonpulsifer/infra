/**
 * The two view assertions Tasks 39 and 40 name, and the §18 rules around them.
 *
 * These are rendered to static markup rather than driven in a browser. That is
 * the right depth for what is being claimed: every rule under test is a
 * statement about **what appears on the screen in a given state**, and none of
 * them is about interaction. A test that needed a click would be testing Radix.
 *
 * The screens are rendered from `demo/scenarios.ts`, which is the placeholder
 * data. When the query commands replace it these tests keep their subject —
 * they assert over `DeployView` and `WorkspaceView`, and those types are the
 * contract the queries will have to meet.
