## CloudEvents

If you'd like to send instructions to radiopi0 with cloudevents, follow a similar pattern with `cloudevents.service` and interact with the web service by sending it a cloud event.

```sh
curl -X POST \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -H "ce-specversion: 1.0" \
    -H "ce-source: https://github.com/jonpulsifer/cloudlab/rpi/radiopi0" \
    -H "ce-type: dev.pulsifer.radio.request" \
    -H "ce-id: lolpotato-123" \
    -d '{"action":"rainbow"}' \
    http://radiopi0:3000
```
